I have develeped this Android App which allows users to search for weather information of any city around the world, save cities to favorites and tweet about a city's current weather. The backend service is written in Node.js and is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

The home screen of the app is where the user can view the weather conditions of the current location along with dot indicators which provide a sliding view to any favorite cities added by the user.

Also, a search view is provided at the top where the user can search for the weather conditions of any city around the world using google "Autocomplete" feature.
